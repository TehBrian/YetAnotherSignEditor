- Toggle plugin features per-player.
- Use either legacy color codes or [MiniMessage][MiniMessage] to format text.
- All plugin messages are easily configurable.
- Separate permissions for sign coloring and sign editing.

Above all, it just feels good to use! No bloat, no extra features.

## Alternate README.md
Do you prefer READMEs that talk to you directly (at the expense of being easy to
read)? Would you like to hear the "witty" comments of my 15-year-old self? Then,
oh *boy* have I got something for you! Head on over
to [OLD_README.md](OLD_README.md) and experience true enlightenment.
