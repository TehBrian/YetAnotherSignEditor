# YetAnotherSignEditor
Easily edit signs with support for colors.

## .. Another one?
Yeah yeah, I know. We didn't need another sign editing plugin floating around.
I have good reason for creating this one, though! All the available sign editing
plugins were either outdated, ugly, or they didn't work how I wanted them to.
This plugin is not outdated, not ugly, and it works just how I want it to!

## What makes this plugin better?
Try it out for yourself and see if you like it, but I'll list off the reasons
that I would personally use this plugin over others:

* The interface is clean, intuitive, and easy on the eyes.
* Each player can individually toggle plugin features on and off.
* Sign coloring and sign editing can be toggled separately. Want to edit signs
but need to use "&5" without it being turned into a color? Go ahead.
* Editing a sign reverts text colors back into color codes for easy editing.
* **All** plugin messages are easily configurable in the config.
* There are separate permissions for sign coloring and sign editing.

Above all, though, it just feels good to use! No bloat, no extra features. Just
install the plugin and you're good to go!

## Cool! How do I get it?
First and foremost, you'll need to use Paper. Sorry to anyone who uses Spigot,
but Paper has an API feature that this plugin requires in order to work. If
there's enough demand, I'll see about porting it to Spigot. ~~or boycotting
them till they add that freakin API method~~

Once you're using Paper, just drag and drop the plugin jar into your plugins
folder! The jar can be found [here](https://github.com/ItsTehBrian/YetAnotherSignEditor/releases).

If you'd like to build the jar yourself, it's quite easy. I'm a bit too lazy
to write it up again, so just follow the tutorial from my other plugin's
README, found [here](https://github.com/ItsTehBrian/BuildersUtilities#how-do-i-build-it-myself).
You don't need BuildTools for this plugin, though, so just start at step 3.

## What are the permissions and commands?
You can do /yase in-game to find a list of all commands. The permissions
can be found [here](https://github.com/ItsTehBrian/YetAnotherSignEditor/blob/master/src/main/resources/plugin.yml).
