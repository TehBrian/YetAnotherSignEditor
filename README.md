## Features

- Edit signs with a command or directly in the sign interface.
- Toggle sign editing and sign formatting separately and per-player.
- Use either [MiniMessage][MiniMessage] or legacy formatting to format text.
- All plugin messages are easily configurable.
- Separate permissions for sign coloring and sign editing.

Above all, it just feels good to use! No bloat, no extra features.
